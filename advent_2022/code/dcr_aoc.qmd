## Problem 1

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}

## Problem

The jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Elves' expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input). | The Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.

For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:

1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000

This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:

- The first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.
- The second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.
- The third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.
- The fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories.
- The fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.

In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by the fourth Elf).

Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?
:::

1. Enter the data into a database:

```{python}
#| label: day-1.1_dataframe

# Load input data
    #* Open the txt file and enter the lines into a list object
with open("../data/day-1-1-input.txt") as f:
    txt = [line.strip() for line in f]
    #* Create a list of list objects based on the empty element
txt2 = [list(sub) for ele, sub in groupby(txt, key = bool) if ele]
    #* convert the elements of the list of list objects to integers
txt3 = [[int(j) for j in i] for i in txt2]

# Convert to dataframe
day1 = pl.DataFrame(
    { "Calories": txt3 # add calories column from txt3 list
    }
)

```

2. Now groupby elf and see which one has most:

```{python}
#| label: day-1-1-database-count

day1_2 = day1.with_column(
    pl.col("Calories").arr.eval(pl.element()
    .sum()).alias("Total") # take each element in the list for the Calories column, and sum it, then put that in a Total column
).with_column(
    pl.col("Total").arr.get(0).cast(pl.Int64).alias("Total") # made Total a list column, grab the element and just write over it, so it is int column
).with_column(
    pl.col("Total").sort_by("Total") # sort the dataframe by the total column
)
```

:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
## Part 1 Answer

```{python}
#| label: display-day-1-1-answer

# Print answer
print(
    day1_2.filter( # filter from day1_2 
        pl.col("Total") == pl.col("Total").max() # find the maximum element in Total column
    )
)
```
:::

## Problem 2

2. Get three elves with most calories

```{python}
#| label: day1-select-top-3
day1_3 = day1_2.select( # select from day1_2
    pl.col("Total").top_k(k = 3) # take the rows with the highest three Total
    )
```

3. Sum the top three

```{python}
#| label: day1-sum
day1_3_ans = day1_3.sum() # print the sum of the top 3
```

4. Store the dataframe into the database

```{python}
#| label: store-day-1-day1
# Convert day12 to pyarrow
day1_4 = day1_3.to_arrow()
# Store dataframe as table
db.execute('''
    create or replace table day_1_1 as select * from day1_4
''')
```

:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal"}

## Part 2 Answer
```{python}
print(day1_3_ans)
```
